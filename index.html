            I am an early career arts professional from Sydney, New South Wales.
            My practice represents a new wave of curatorship; I work across curatorship
            and artistic programs to further public engagement with art, artists and
            ideas through unique and inclusive audience experiences.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-6">
            I graduated in 2011 from UniSA with a Bachelor of Visual Arts, first-class
             Honours and have since programmed and produced events for major cultural institutions;
             worked in production and management for international festivals; facilitated educational
             workshops for families and at-risk youth; co-directed <strong>FELTspace Gallery</strong>; and produced independent
             contemporary music festivals.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-6">
            I am currently embarking on my final year of my Masters of Curating and Cultural Leadership at UNSW.
            Prior to this, I was employed as the <strong>Art Gallery of South Australia’s</strong> inaugural Teen Programs Officer,
            programming and producing Neo, the Gallery’s free bi-monthly festival-style event just for 13 to 17 years olds,
            which regularly attracts an audience of 600+ teens. Here, I also worked closely with the Gallery’s Director, Nick Mitzevich
            and Assistant Director, Creative Programs, Lisa Slade to program and produce festival and exhibition openings;
            talks, tours, lectures and symposia; art fairs and auctions; school holiday and GP workshops; performance; live music;
            and other ‘up-late’ events.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-12">
            I have nearly 10 years of experience working in exhibition and event
            production and management for organisations including <strong>Tandanya National
            Aboriginal Cultural Institute</strong>; <strong>WOMADelaide</strong>; <strong>Adelaide Festival</strong>; and as Team
            Leader of the <strong>Australian Pavilion at Venice Biennale</strong> in 2013, as well as
            producing independent contemporary music festivals Half Strange (2016/17/18)
            and BungSound (2017). I have received professional grants from the Adelaide City Council,
            ArtsSA, Australia Council, Carclew, Helpmann Academy, and NAVA.
